# Hospitality-business-power-bi-dashBoard
I have created a dashboard by a hotel chain data that helps us to find out the insights of that hotel-chain business.
KPIS
Revpar = revenue per available rooms ,
DSRN = daily sellable room nights,
ADR= average daily rates,
DBRN = daily booked room night,
DURN = daily utilized room
Occupancy%
Realisation%

Key Insights-
-) by this dashboard we find that the cause of the less average in revenue are the hotels with less occupancy.
-)Highest revenue collecting city is mumbai followed by banglore
-)The priceing of weekdays and weekend days are nearly same so there is no diffrence in revenue of weekdays and weekends
-)Pareto principle- 20% of the hotels are the cause of the 80% percent of revenue average 
-)There is a strong corelation between occupancy and the hotel rating so the rating effect the image of the hotel
-)highest revenue is given by elight rooms
